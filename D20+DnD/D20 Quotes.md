**Cloudward Ho! Poem:**
*On high we go to break the binding bond, Spur outward past beyond,
Set blaze to bravery’s light,*
*Bring hope to starry night,*
*Set wrongs to right, and freedom’s fight*
*To ever chase the day in winged flight*
*On high we go*
*Cloudward, ho*

**Fantasy High: The Universe Cares**
*As above, so below.*
... 
It is up to people to decide whether [things] are bad or good. In the same way that your heart feels and your mind thinks, [we] are the instrument by which the universe cares. If you choose to care, then the universe cares, and if you don't, then it doesn't.
