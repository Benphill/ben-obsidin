**Dagur þrjú - Sail to the Vestmannaeyjar**
Vestmannaeyjar = Vest (West), Mann (Man), Eyjar (Islands)

Icelandic Words:
Skip = Ship
Fiskur = Fish
Sjó = Sea

Discover the Westman Islands, an archipelago of emergent volcanoes that is continuously changing. In 1963 a new Island emerged from the depths and grew for 7 years of ongoing volcanic eruptions.

We take a ferry to Heimaey - Home Island - where another eruption in 1973 nearly destroyed the town and harbor. We will hike on the aftermath of this eruption and learn about how this event affected the local community in the excellent Eldheimar Museum.
