It's no secret that video games are a very popular thing and have been for many years. However, we have also begun to pay more attention to mental health, and we believe that they have had a negative impact on the mental, and by extension, physical health of consumers for reasons such as addiction and social isolation.

**Social Isolation**

- Single player games obviously get you more interested with what's going on in the games than what's happening around you.

- Even multiplayer games limit your connections with others because you are rarely given an opportunity to actually talk with the people you're playing with, and it's really not the same as meeting face-to-face.

- In addition to that, multiplayer games trick you into thinking that you're not socially isolated by making you think that you don't really need to meet up in-person because you talk to your friends all the time online

- According to the World Health Organization, the Covid-19 pandemic caused a rise of 25% in anxiety and depression. A big part of that was that they couldn't go visit their friends. Voluntarily choosing to spend a lot of your time playing video games, even online games with your friends, is subjecting yourself to the same thing that people were forced to do during a global pandemic.
