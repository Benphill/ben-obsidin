**Part A**
Jobs:
Housing prices and the cost of living in general is very high in Ontario compared to other provinces, and especially high when compared to some other countries. However, if this mining operation were to go through, thousands of jobs will be created, which will help a lot of people earn enough money to continue living in the region.

Healthcare and Sanitation:
Some of the elements that would be mined from this area are very beneficial to keeping people healthy. A major example of this is copper, which is great at killing disease-causing bacteria, so much so that hospitals have adopted copper doorknobs to minimize the transfer of disease.

Environment:
Platinum, another element that would be mined from the Ring of Fire, is extremely useful for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. That's because it is a major part of catalytic converters, a device that is most often inside of cars that reduce the emissions of harmful gases.

First Nations:
The Ontario government is working with the First Nations people to come to an agreement about what to do with the area, which builds a better relationship, and the mining operations would supply the First Nations people from around the area with career opportunities.

**Part B**
A big problem people may have with the mining of the Ring of Fire is that of environmental damage, and a big part of that is what will happen after the mining finishes. It's a common problem that mine owners will simply fill the massive hole they have created with water, and maybe plant a few trees, but the lake that is created is incredibly toxic which leads to a complete destruction of the native animals' habitat. To solve this problem, we could adopt a similar water treatment strategy as Oceana Gold who operated the Reefton mine restoration project. It focused heavily on removing toxic chemicals from the water added to the closed mine, meaning that the water left behind was no longer nearly as toxic. Alongside this, we would need to focus on replanting any native plants that might have been removed in the mining process in an attempt to restore the balance of the ecosystem from before the mining started.
