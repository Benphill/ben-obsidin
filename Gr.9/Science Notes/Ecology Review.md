Energy Flow:
10% of energy is passed from one trophic level to the next. When a plant or animal dies, decomposers take the remaining energy and puts it back in the soil.

Nitrogen Cycle:
Nitrogen in the atmosphere gets eaten by bacteria and turned into nitrogen that plants can use. Plants then absorb the nitrogen through their roots, which helps them grow. If a plant dies, decomposers take the remaining nitrogen and place it back into the soil. While in the soil, nitrogen may undergo a process called volatilization, which turns it back into atmospheric nitrogen. Fertilizers contain pure nitrogen which can kill the soil by not letting the bacteria grow, and it can be washed into bodies of water which can destroy the ecosystem by letting algae grow greatly. Nitrogen fixer plants contain lots of bacteria that make nitrogen usable for plants, so planting them alongside other plants, or only planting them one year can greatly improve the nitrogen level and overall soil health.

Carbon Cycle:
Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is used by plants to create sugars, and it emits oxygen as waste. When plants die, some animals may eat them, allowing carbon to be passed to the animals, but it is breathed out through respiration as they breathe in oxygen. When those animals die, their bodies get decomposed, and the carbon inside them can get trapped underground, eventually creating fossil fuels, which can be burned to release the carbon back into the atmosphere. A similar thing happens in the water, where carbon can get trapped underwater, letting organisms consume it, and eventually putting it back in the soil after they die. The burning of fossil fuels causes much more carbon dioxide to enter the atmosphere than there should be, leading to heat getting trapped inside the atmosphere, causing global warming.
