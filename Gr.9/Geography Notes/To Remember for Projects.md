**How to have a good life:**
Your actions are satisfying (job, volunteering...)
A community to share your actions with and to give new ideas
To not have to worry about money or resources

**Une philosophie pour comprendre le bonheur:**
Everybody on Earth has something to do, and you need to find what makes you happy
Money can buy pleasure but not happiness
