I know that there's a lot of people in here that have pets, and one problem that happens to me with my dog very often is how I don't know what he's trying to say. ==Well that won't be a problem any more with the pet translator collar. Simply put it around your pet's neck, and it will instantly translate what they're saying.== Now you will always know exactly what they want, and you can easily get them to stop whining.
