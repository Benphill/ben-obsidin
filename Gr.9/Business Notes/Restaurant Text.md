About the Restaurant:

As an Alum of the FIRST Robotics team the 2702 Rebels, back in 2040, I decided to create a restaurant around the program to bring more attention to it and help support it. This restaurant is a very different experience than others around the area because 75% of all profits will go directly into funding the FIRST organization, and we have a display for many past robots from different seasons and teams all the way from FLL to FRC.

About Us:

I started this restaurant back in 2040 to show my support for the FIRST organization. I had been a member of the Rebels for all my high school years, and I wanted to help in a bigger way than just mentoring the team, so I got together with some old friends who are also alumni from the team and started this restaurant.

Woodie Flowers:

Dr. Woodie Flowers was born on November 18, 1943 in Louisiana. When he was only seventeen, he, while in a car with four friends, he was hit by another vehicle killing two people in his vehicle and one in the other. Because of this, he developed a supreme hatred to violence, and vowed to create something to stop it and create a community based on peace and his later named "gracious professionalism." He taught Introduction to Design at MIT starting in the 1970s in which he would create a challenge for his students to compete in. He would have them form teams and throughout the semester, his students would use many random parts like paper clips, bolts, and random electronics to make robotic devices to complete the challenge. They would compete before an audience, which lead to PBS starting to broadcast the competitions on the series "Discover: The World of Science". In the early 1990s, the inventor Dean Kamen recruited him to turn this idea into a contest for high school students, creating the FIRST Robotics Competition. Along with Dean, they created the non profit company FIRST, to help inspire students to embrace STEM. Throughout this entire time, he had been living with a "misshapen elbow and an arm that he was never able to straighten" (Rifkin, 2019) after he fell from a tree as a child. Their non-profit has greatly improved the lives of people all over the world, and his gracious professionalism is still an extremely important lesson. His determination and commitment to peace and togetherness are a great inspiration for me, and this restaurant was made to continue his legacy.

Restaurant Details:

Atmosphere - Our restaurant really brings you into the world of FIRST Robotics. We have TVs on each wall showing any live matches happening, and replays of important matches when there aren't any being broadcast. We have many displays set up showing off robots from many different teams from years before, and often we have students at their team's display ready to answer any questions customers might have about the team or the program. A majority of the building is dark, with bright blue or red lights lighting up the tables, to resemble the world championships in Houston.

Food - We sell a lot of food that you'd think of when you think of a diner, including our all day breakfast.

Where and When to Find Us - We're open from 7:30am to 11:00pm every day, but it's reservation only during the world championships and local tournaments. We're situated at 170 University Avenue West, right near the University of Waterloo.

Target Market - We're hoping to reach anyone who wants to learn more about the FIRST organization, or people who are already a part of it and want to have a place to go to meet others in the community.
