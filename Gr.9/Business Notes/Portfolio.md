My name is Ben Phillips, and I believe that the entrepreneurial mindset has greatly helped me throughout the duration of this course. To me, the entrepreneurial mindset involves taking risks, being innovative, being resilient, being passionate, and never giving up. These entrepreneurial traits have been very important throughout this semester, as during many projects there were problems and setbacks that I have had to overcome, such as failing to make a profit in the entrepreneurial challenge, and I believe these traits, especially being resilient and innovative have helped me overcome these obstacles and do my best in this class. Outside this class, I also believe that the entrepreneurial mindset can help with solving problems and making decisions at home or at work. When in groups, I believe I have demonstrated something of a democratic leadership style as I make sure to let everyone share their ideas, and it has helped groups I've been in succeed with activities we were tasked with.
